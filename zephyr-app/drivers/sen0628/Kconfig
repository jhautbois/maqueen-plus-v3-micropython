	help
	  Device driver initialization priority.

config SEN0628_DEFAULT_MODE
	int "Default matrix mode (4 or 8)"
	default 8
	range 4 8
	help
	  Initial matrix mode after driver initialization.
	  4 = 4x4 matrix (16 zones, faster)
	  8 = 8x8 matrix (64 zones, higher resolution)

config SEN0628_READ_DELAY_MS
	int "Delay between point reads (ms)"
	default 10
	range 5 100
	help
	  Delay in milliseconds after sending a point read command
	  before reading the response. Benchmark shows 10ms is reliable.
	  Lower values (5ms) may work but increase risk of read errors.

	int "Mode change settling time (ms)"
	default 5000
	range 1000 10000
	help
	  Time to wait after changing matrix mode for sensor to stabilize.
	  The sensor requires approximately 5 seconds after mode change.
